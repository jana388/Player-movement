# Player-movement
Tutorial for the player movement in my game
In this tutorial I will teach you how to move your player on X axis (left and right) in a 3D Pong game. It is beginner friendly, so anyone who is new to coding is welcome to try it out

## Prerequisites
Although this tutorial is easy to understand, there are some prerequisites to complete this without getting confused mid way through. 
Firstly, you have to have these programmes installed and ready to use: 
- Unity
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022

 This tutorial is made in Unity 2022.3.46f1 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, so I would suggest using the same  to avoid any confusion

 If there is any assistance needed on downloading these programs, visit this site:

 Also, if you are not completely sure how to navigate in Unity, follow this tutorial as an introduction or a reminder:

 ## Objective
 The objective of this tutorial is to set the scene (add the players, ball, platform and the walls), add rigid body, physics, trigger and components to the objects as well as the Player C# script

 ## Setting the project

 ## Setting up the scene
 This is how I would like the scene to look before adding any code

 In this scene, we have 4 cubes (2 players and 2 walls), 1 sphere (ball) and 1 plane (platform where everything is going to be on)
After adjusting the objects, create an empty object and group them

As you can see in the picture, I named it Pong, but it is really up to your preference
